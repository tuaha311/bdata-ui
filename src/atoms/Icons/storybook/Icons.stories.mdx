# Icons

Icons from the Feather icon library. They're utilized here using `react-feather`.

## Usage

The icons can be used in any situation you deem fit. To use one, call upon `<Icons />`, and then pass it the attributes, or props, you want it to have. 

<Icons
    name="Camera"
    color="#2493FF"
    size="100px"
    strokeWidth="1.5px"
    alt="Camera Icon"
/>

Here, you can see how to call upon the camera icon and how to set the desired props:

```ts
    <Icons
    name="Camera"
    color="#2493FF"
    size="100px"
    strokeWidth="1.5px"
    alt="Camera Icon"
/>
```

## Props

The props allow you to customize the icon you're displaying, along with its color, size, strokeWidth, and the alt tag for accessibility.

<ArgsTable of={Icons} />

<Story story={stories.Icons} />
